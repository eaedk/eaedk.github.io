# Description
This is the repository of [My Personal Website](https://eaedk.github.io)  using Jekyll and based on a Github webpage template.

# Purposes of the website
This website aims to present my self and also to share knowledges, experiences and opinions about Science, Technology, Programming, Machine Learning and all the related topics I like and I would like to write about.

# More About this Project
I created this webpage to have a fancy way of expression and sharing. I have been encouraged by people to start it and a friend of mine, [Patrick Nsukami](https://nskm.xyz/), helped me to setup the project.
